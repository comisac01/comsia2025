          <p style="font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; padding: 20px; font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;">The School
            of
            Open Learning [a part of the Campus of Open Learning] formerly
            known as The School of Correspondence Courses and Continuing Education, established under the University of
            Delhi in 1962, is a pioneer Institution in the field of Distance Education in India.

            The country witnessed the beginning of an alternate mode of education when the School started with a modest
            admission of 900 students in 1962.
            The School enrolled more than two lakhs students in the Academic Session 2006-2007. On many occasions our
            students have been toppers in various disciplines.
            The admission process for various courses in the School is governed by the norms established by the
            University of Delhi.
            The examination is also conducted by the University of Delhi. The University of Delhi confers the degree to
            the students of the School as it
            does in the case of its other constituent colleges. There is no differentiation in the course curriculum
            followed by the School of Open Learning and
            other constituent colleges and Departments of the University of Delhi.
            In an effort to reach out to a larger number of students the school is in the process of opening up Study
            Center in the Eastern and the Western part of the National Capital Region of Delhi.


            The School offers Undergraduate/ Postgraduate Degree courses in the subjects of Arts/Humanities and
            Commerce. The medium of instruction is primarily through well- prepared printed course material which is
            distributed by mail to all the enrolled students. This is also supplemented through Personal Contact Program
            conducted for the benefit of students at various study centers run by the School. An experienced faculty is
            always available at the main campus for academic interaction with students.

            The School offers learning through the distance education mode which is a viable alternative for students
            who need a flexible medium of instruction to attain higher education and vocational skills.
